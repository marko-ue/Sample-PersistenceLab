/**
 * Example UInstancedActorsData that replicates Visual State to dehydrated instances on late-joining clients.
 *
 * The problem: when an instanced actor is dehydrated there's no actor to replicate Visual State through, so a
 * late-joining client has no way to learn which visualization (ISM mesh) an instance should be showing.
 *
 * The insight: FInstancedActorsDelta already replicates CurrentLifecyclePhaseIndex to ALL clients (including
 * late-joiners) via the FastArraySerializer on UInstancedActorsData::InstanceDeltas - for free, out of the box.
 * The base ApplyInstanceDelta receives that phase index but only ever acts on destruction, silently ignoring it.
 *
 * This subclass closes that gap: on the client it maps the replicated lifecycle phase to a visualization and
 * applies the ISM mesh switch synchronously - no custom replication required.
 *
 * Convention: visualization indices must be ordered to match lifecycle phase indices (phase N -> visualization N).
 * This is enforced at IAD setup time by the order visualizations are registered (see
 * UExampleInstancedActorComponent::ModifyMassEntityTemplate).
 *
 * To use: set AInstancedActorsManager::InstancedActorsDataClass to this class on the manager.
