/**
 * Bridges a hydrated ACharacter to its backing Mass entity. Add to a BP descendant of APersistenceLabCharacter
 * that is selected as the HighResSpawnedActor in the UMassRepresentationTrait of the entity config.
 *
 * Authority model: actor is authoritative while hydrated. Fragments are written on EndPlay (the actor's
 * dehydration point) and on UPersistenceWorldSubsystem::OnPreFlushMassEntityData (save-time flush).
 *
 * GAS health auto-sync: if the owning actor implements IAbilitySystemInterface and the ASC carries a
 * UHealthAttributeSet, this component automatically pushes Snapshot.Health/MaxHealth into the AS on
 * hydrate and pulls them back into PendingSnapshot before each flush. BP listeners can still override
 * (the OnFlushPending broadcast fires after the C++ pull).
 *
 * Owning actor still wires the non-health fields:
 *  - BP-bind OnHydrated and use Snapshot.ActiveStateId / Snapshot.NavTarget to seed StateTree / nav.
 *  - Continuously update PendingSnapshot via SetPendingSnapshot, OR bind OnFlushPending and push then.
