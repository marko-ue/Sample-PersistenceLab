/**
 * Opt-in component that lets an actor be re-resolved across save/load by its previous-session identity.
 *
 * On PrePersistObject the owner's (level path, actor FName) is captured and serialized by LSP.
 * On PostRestoreObject the component registers itself with UPersistableActorReferenceManager keyed by
 * that previous-session identity, even when the owner's runtime FName has changed (e.g., respawned runtime actors).
 *
 * Map-placed actors don't need this component — their FName is stable from the asset and resolves via level scan.
 * Use it when (a) the actor is runtime-spawned (name not stable across sessions), or (b) the actor may be ejected
 * and respawned at runtime by LSP and other code holds references to it.
