	 * Snapshots all live entities carrying FPersistableEntityConfigFragment (i.e., spawned from a config that uses
	 * UPersistableEntityConfigTrait), grouped by their source UMassEntityConfigAsset. One snapshot is produced per config.
	 *
	 * Phase-safety: snapshot work always runs in a phase-quiescent slot.
	 *   - Mid-play: deferred to the next EMassProcessingPhase::FrameEnd. PreSnapshot runs first, then the snapshot.
	 *   - Tear-down (World->bIsTearingDown): runs synchronously. Safe because OnWorldBeginTearDown itself is
	 *     dispatched between frames, outside any active phase, and no further phase ticks will occur before
	 *     UMassSimulationSubsystem::Deinitialize stops the phase manager.
	 *
	 * Fail-safe: if the world begins tearing down between scheduling and the next phase end, the snapshot runs
	 * synchronously from the teardown broadcast instead of being lost.
	 *
	 * OnComplete always fires (with an empty array if no entities or no Mass simulation present).

	 * EMassProcessingPhase::FrameEnd so they don't collide with phase-executing processors. OnComplete fires after the
	 * work is done. Snapshots whose SourceConfigAsset cannot be resolved are skipped with a warning.
	 *
	 * Fail-safe: if the world begins tearing down before the next phase end, the restore is abandoned and OnComplete
	 * still fires (restoring during teardown serves no purpose).

	 * deserialized data will be incorrect.
